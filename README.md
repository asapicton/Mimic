MIMIC GAME VBeta1.1

DESCRIPTION

A simple puzzle game where you control two sprites at the same time. By making use of walls and barriers (purple), both sprites, the player (blue), and the mimic (red) must be 
positioned on their winning spaces in order to advance to the next level.

MOVEMENT

While both the player (blue) and the mimic (red) move at the same time, they are not necessary completely linked. If one cannot move in a certain direction while the
other can, movement for one is possible
Further, you will notice the mimic moves two spaces instead of one for each movement. To escape this and move onto the "odd" colored spaces, one may intentionally hit a
barrier that has a free space before it, allowing the mimic to move 1 space instead of 2.
